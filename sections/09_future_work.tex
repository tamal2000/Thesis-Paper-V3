The paper only managed to cover the initial part of developing a data-driven machine learning approach to identify suspicious companies from real-world data. This is of course a continuous process and goes through an iterative process to improve the mining techniques and machine learning models.  below are some of the future steps that can be taken to improve the model. 


\begin{itemize}
    \item Missing Value handling: while preparing the model it was found that there are lots of missing values, after investigating it was found that some of the missing values can be found in a separate report. Including these missing values should improve the model further. 
    \item External Information: In many markets, there are existing external resources like online API which provides business information in a structured manner. Including external information may save time on feature engineering. 
    \item Neural Networks: Even though the Random Forest has shown the best result so far, ANN also had shown some good promises. As not too many varieties of Neural Networks were used in the current models, it can be also a good idea to try other types of neural networks.
